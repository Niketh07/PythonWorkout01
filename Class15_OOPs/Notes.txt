OOPS IN PYTHON
---------------
The oops concept focuses on writing the reusable code.

It is a widespread technique to solve the problem by creating objects.


1. Class

2. Method

3. Object

4. Inheritance

5. Polymorphism

6. Data abstraction

7. Encapsulation

	
CLASS :


The class can be defined as a collection of objects.

It is a logical entity that has some specific attributes and methods.


defined using class keyword

syntax:

class ClassName:     
        <statement-1>     
        .     
        .      
        <statement-N>    


METHOD :

The method is a function that is associated with an object.


self parameter : The self is used to represent the instance of the class.

With this keyword, you can access the attributes or variables and methods of the class in python.


OBJECT :

The object is an entity that has state and behavior.




class car:  # created a class named "car"

    def move(self):  # created a method or function named move
        print("Car will move ; once get started")

obj_car=car()  # created an object for class named "obj_car"
obj_car.move() # calling a function and its behaviour
