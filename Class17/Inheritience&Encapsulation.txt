Inheritence allows us to create a new class from an exsisting class
Newly created class is sub class/derived class
the super class is called the base class/parent class

super() => this function is used in child to access all property and methods of parent


Encapsulation
To prevent data modification accidently

Protected members
=================
They can be accessed only within the class. This can be accessed in the sub class

Private members
=================
They are same as protected . However, this cannot be used even to child class
